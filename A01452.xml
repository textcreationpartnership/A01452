            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a matter of no mean maruel, that man ſo quicke-ſighted in worldly affairs, ſhould be ſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind in things concerning God. That whereas he is <hi>Totus occulus &amp; manus,</hi> all cie and hand, to obſerue and practiſe in liuely imitational other things, only this main and fundamentall thing, how to order his conuerſation right, that he might ſee the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of his God, he is wholy ignorant of: Though he wanteth the wings of a doue, to flie to the vtmoſt parts of the earth, yet he can ſo ſubdue to himſelfe his mules and drome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries, as their feete like harts feete ſhall carry them whither they liſt. And though he hath not the finnes of a fiſh, to ſcudde through the channells and pathes of deepe waters: yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof, his head hath bin occupied in excogitating great veſſels, keels and tall ſhips to tranſport euery where. Naturally he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed of himſelfe, yet this art and cunning hath deuiſed for him ſelfe, his ſword, his bow, and his ſpeare, and all ſufficiency of weapons of offence, and armor of proofe to couer his head in the day of battell, enough for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. He is vnable ſo to tune his pipes, and chaunt and ſing vnder euery green tree with the nightingale and melodious bird: yet that
<pb facs="tcp:19506:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>his muſick is of more delight, which by Lute and Harp, and lowd Cymbals, and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and deuiſed inſtruments, he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and framed to himſelf. Thundrings and coruſcations of the ayre, are peculiar vnto God, the arrowes of his quiuer, and his Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffes arrant, and Purſeuants of his anger: yet behold in a ſtrange and prodigious imitation hereof, he hath found out moſt fearful roring Cannons of all ſorts, moſt horrible to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of. Finally, he prouideth for this kind of life, infinite kinds of waies, which are like an intricate maze paſt our finding out, by laws, by trades, by all manner of learning. But <hi>Finis vltimus,</hi> the laſt end of all is leaſt conſidered of, wherein the whole ſtate of all bleſſednes of the man ſo fully doth conſiſt. Man (as ſaith the Pſalmograph) is deceitfull vppon the weights, and is altogether lighter then vanity it ſelfe. Man being in honor, and hauing no vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, is compared to the beaſts that periſh. We bewaile thoſe our friends that are dead in body: O let vs weepe and bewaile their eſtate who are dead in heart, and are twice dead, and to be plucked vp by the rootes. The Apoſtle accounted all things, but dung to gain Ieſus Chriſt. This is better then the gold of Ophyr or India, albeit we ſtop our eies with waxe, and bind a napkin
<pb facs="tcp:19506:6"/>before our eies of knowledge, and think that there is a wiſdom in the world far better then this. Theſewipe their mouths with the whore in the Reuelation, &amp; ſay vnto themſelues, that they are rich, and need no more, whenas they are the pooreſt and moſt miſerable of al men, as the laſt end ſhal proue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

               <p>Our Euangelicall Merchant in this place, got not vp theſe goods by gazing about him, in an idle ſpeculation: but he buckled himſelf to the ordinary means of attaining therevnto by induſtruous operation.

               <p>Wherefore in this man, ech man may ſee the nature of his taske that expect this mans waies. He muſt not ſtretch himſelfe vpon his bed, and fold his armes to ſleep: he muſt not keepe his tabernacle, or ſtand in the market place, but he muſt gird vp his reynes, put his ſandalls vpon his feet, he hath a painfull pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage &amp; chargeable voiage; he muſt haue the feet of an Hind, and the wings of a Doue,<note place="margin">Abac. 3.</note> and giue all diligence to find out this hidden and vnſpeakable treaſure,<note place="margin">Pſal. 55</note> and to make pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of it.</p>

               <p>Yet let vs further preſſe this ſweete and comfortable doctrine, by making this the caſe.<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> A ſerpent hath bitten a man vnto the death with his venemous mouth, and there is no other meanes to preſerue his life, but an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans death, ſome man muſt die by lic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him whole, and by taking away his rancke contagion with his tongue; wel, ſome baſe man of no reputation may ſerue this turn; yet life for life, that muſt be the ranſom.

               <p>Or,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> if you pleaſe, let vs paraphraſe thus: there are notorious theeues for capital crimes committed to the gaole, and the doome of death by the ſearlet Iudge is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out againſt them, and they muſt be executed all the ſorte
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19506:55"/>of them: But loe, as God would haue it, in the meane time commeth the Kings ſonne with his retinue and guarde about him: at the ſight of whome, theſe enormous caitiues out of their grates and priſon holes, crie with a lowde voyce, ſaying, Saue vs maiſter leſt we periſh. The Kings ſonne hereat amazed, and ſtanding ſtill, asketh his followers what this clamorous and ſhreeking out-cry meaneth.

But the bowelles of this young Prince, moued with their dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and moſt extreame eſtate, commaundeth them to be ſlayde, and offereth himſelfe as a ranſome and redemption to his father for them. Whoſe heart is ſo ſtony, that will not be mollified and broken in peeces, vpon ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of ſuch ſtrange and vnſpeakeable ioy? Our caſe is euen the ſame, and this is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which we haue by Chriſt, the obiect of our ioy, the ſubiect of the Goſpel, which wee preach vnto you.

And by his red blood the ranſome of our ſinnes, he hath pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the wrath of his Father, and hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vs his priſoners, appointed vnto death. For this cauſe,<note place="margin">Pſalme 126</note> let our tongues be filled with laughter and our hearts with ioy. And let vs gladly entertayne all ſuch as bring this happy legation vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The longing expectation which our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had of this,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.</note> lifted vp their hearts, and through this, they were comforted before he was exhibited.</p>

               <p>The wicked,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> who are ſenſeleſſe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feeling, both of God and godlineſſe, are like green and moiſt faggot ſticks, which are ſo far from taking hold of the fire put vnder them, as thorough the ſap that diſtilleth from them they do extinguiſh and vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it. The hearts of the godly, are of the nature and condition of the gun-powder, which is preſently ſet on fire by the leſt touch but of a ſparke that is put vnto it. So the fire of Gods word is choaked and ſmothered in vngodly men, being not a fit combuſtible ſubiect to worke vpon. But it ſoone maketh a light and bright flame, in the ſoules of his ſaints, as beeing a ſulphurous and apte mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, vpon which it may extend and exerciſe his force.</p>
               <p>A kettle of water ſet on the fire,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> aſ ſoon as it conceiueth the heate thereof, expreſſeth, as we ſee, the motion of the fire, for albeit, it be a heauy and waighty body, and ſo by nature

The bodies of the righteous, howſoeuer by nature they are of an earthly and heauy ſubſtaunce, and ſo do bend downeward and haue a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the world: yet the fire of Gods ſpirit that burneth within them contrary to their courſe, lifteth them vpward, and cauſeth them to mount vp to heauen.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as <hi>Iohn</hi> wept vntill the booke was opened,<note place="margin">Apoc. 5</note> and ſo ſoone as it was opened, all the Elders ſung: ſo let vs adiudge it to be the greateſt cauſe of weeping, when the word is taken from vs, and the beſt occaſion that can be of ioy, when it is reſtored and giuen to vs againe.</p>

               <p>He dodgeth not with God,<note place="margin">Act. 5</note> as <hi>Ananias</hi> did with <hi>Peter,</hi> keeping part behind. He putteth not his hand to the Lords plough, and hath an eie with <hi>Lots</hi> wife vnto <hi>Sodome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke. 9</note> He min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not God of any part of his dew, as the King of <hi>Arams</hi> muſter-maſter,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>We are reaſonably contented to part ſtakes with God, and willing enough with the falſe mother,<note place="margin">1.

               <p>But God may not indure ſuch paltring at our hands.</p>
               <p>The true mother may not abide to heare of the mangling of her child; and <hi>Dauid</hi> may not digeſt ſuch barbarous indignity offered to his ſeruants, and God may not ſuffer him ſelfe to be ſo mocked; as to haue his glory of which he is ſo iealous, communicated vnto others.</p>
               <p>Very many we find, howbeit, otherwiſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:19506:88"/>of very proper parts, &amp; induments of nature, who halt with God too much, and cannot, without ſtrugling to one way or other, keep in the right way: we are as the graine that wanteth meaſure, and the gold that will not hold weight. There is in euery one of vs, ſomewhat which blemiſeth and diſgraceth all our beauty.</p>
               <p>Many, albeit they are of chaſte behauior, of very ciuil nature, and (as by outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance it ſeemeth) of religious diſpoſition: yet are their minds fixed vpon couetouſnes, they go after worldly thoughts, and incomber themſelues with <hi>Martha</hi> about many things.<note place="margin">Luke. 10.</note> They cannot be parted by any meanes from their profit, or ſtride ouer thoſe blockes that lie in their way, or deuote themſelues wholy with this Ieweller vnto God Wee find other ſome of liberall and bountifull affections, yet violently miſcaried with a deſire of ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <p>Be not deceiued, God will not be ſtinted, he will haue all, or nothing at all of thee: and when thou giueſt all, thou giueſt him but his owne. Thou doſt but like the coppy holder that payeth his rent, and performeth his bounden homage and ſeruice vnto his Lord, the diminution of any iote thereof beeing the forfeit of thy whole coppy.</p>
               <p>This is a ſlye pollicie of the diuell, to haue vs dernie chriſtians, to ſerue GOD by halues, to drawe vs on to ſome duties of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, that whilſt we doe flatter and beguile

               <p>Thus he playde with <hi>Herod</hi> who hauing ſnarled and hooked him before with the hooke and line of inordinate luſt,<note place="margin">Mark. 6.</note> he dallieth with him, and giueth him ſome libertie to heare <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> willingly, and to reforme many things according to his directions.</p>
               <p>As along as the diuell hath vs vnder his line, and hath any hold of vs, either by our pride, by our vſurie, by our couetouſnes, by our enuie, by our emulation, by our ambition, by our hatred, by our crueltie, by any kinde of ſinne, he will ſo ſporte with vs, as he will be ſure of vs, he will not let vs goe.</p>
               <p>For as a bird, if ſhe be limed,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> and taken by one wing, cannot flie away: ſo though we pray or faſt, or giue our almes, repaire to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and giue our ſelues to many good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions:

Giue thou the diuell but an enterance into thee, and thou ſhalt neuer remoue him, but he will be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the laſt ſeated in thee.</p>
               <p>Chriſt his charge to thoſe that will be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of him,<note place="margin">Math. 11.</note> flatly is this: <hi>Take my yoake vpon you.</hi> He nameth not any parte of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that ſhould be yoaked aboue other, the head, the necke, the ſhoulders or ſuch like; but the whole: that wee ſhould not thinke that we haue ſerued God well, by myncing him a pittance, vnles he hath the whole.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſummoneth al his parts to the Lords courtes.<note place="margin">Pſal. 34. Pſal. 103. Pſal. 119.</note>

               <p>When as <hi>Pharao</hi> could no longer holde the <hi>Iſralites</hi> in durance,<note place="margin">Exod. 10.</note> but the time was come that they ſhould be ſet at libertie, and ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to ſerue the Lord, he craueth that their cattell might remaine behind them: ſo when the diuell is not permitted to domineere as he liſt, to haue his full power and pleaſure ouer vs, he beggeth but a parte and little por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within vs. But giue the diuell that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that <hi>Moſes</hi> gaue to <hi>Pharao,</hi> who ſnobbed him thus roundly; No not a hoofe ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine behinde vs, but euery part ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated vnto God.</p>

               <p>To forſake our wiues, to neglect our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to diſpiſe our frends, to contemne the world, if it be in wordly ſort, and it doth not tend to an heauenly end, it is to no end. The Romane <hi>Curtius,</hi> the <hi>Athanian Codrus,</hi> the <hi>Theban Crates,</hi> and others, the famous philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers of the Gentiles, <hi>Socrates, Diogenes, Bias, Thales, Mileſius, Mucius, Scaeuola, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius, Romanus,</hi> and ſuch like, who haue martyred themſelues, offered ſtrange vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence &amp; torture to their bodies, haue liued pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uate auſtere liues, ſcorned worldly wealth, &amp; haue ſequeſtred themſelues aloofe from al the inticements of the world; inaſmuch as the ends of their actions were in vaine: the lyme, the ſtone, the timber, wanted a foundation wherevpon to leane, all their whole ſtructure and building tumbled down, and all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors and endeuours periſhed.</p>

               <p>Theſe two I hold as good concluſions. Firſt, that all our ſorrowes for our ſinnes, though our contrition were as great as the ſea, if it be only for the feare of hell, and not for Gods loue, and the loue of heauen, can
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:19506:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>do vs no good.<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> For as the confeſſion of a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is conſtrained, who for feare of the racke, and not for any dutifull affection to his prince, bewrayeth and bewaileth his miſche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous deſignements, and this confeſſion and lamentation, turneth not to comfort, but to his certaine deſtruction: ſo ſuch contrition, as commeth by coaction, maketh not vnto ſaluation, but vnto endles perdition. For in ſin there are alwaies theſe two things chiefly to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered. The firſt is, the euil thou haſt wrought againſt God: The ſecond is, the euil that thou haſt brought vpon thy ſelfe, which is eternal damnation. Now if thou beeſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for thine owne miſhap only, and not for the high and mighty indignity offered vnto God, is it not manifeſt, that thou wouldeſt only eſcape that which maketh againſt thee, not caring for that which maketh againſt God, and therfore thy repentance is repelled of God?</p>
               <p>This is made euident by a paire of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Dauid;</hi> they were both of them Kings, both of them ſinned,<note place="margin">1 Sam 15. 2 Sam. 12</note> both of them were reprooued, and both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented: and yet the Lord, who <hi>accepteth no perſons,</hi> accepteth <hi>Dauids,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 10.</note> &amp; excepteth iuſtly againſt <hi>Sauls</hi> repentance: for it was defectiue and faulty in the end, and it was not done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19506:99"/>there was as great oddes and difference as might be, betweene their intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of repentance: <hi>Dauid</hi> repenting that he had loſt God, and <hi>Saul</hi> repenting, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had loſt his kingdome. For he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his mind plainly enough by his wordes to <hi>Samuel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 15</note> ſaying: <hi>Honor me before the elders of my people, and before Iſrael:</hi> So <hi>Saul</hi> might haue bin ſafe and ſetled in his kingdome, and men might do him worſhip, little did <hi>Saul</hi> eſteeme how his GOD was woorſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe <hi>Eſau</hi> went without his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,<note place="margin">Heb. 12</note> though he ſought it with teares and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame paſſions, becauſe they proceeded not from ſincere affections. The loue of God which ſhould haue made them forcible, was wanting to them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond propoſition is as plain as this, that is, that although we doe conforme our ſelues to the Canons of his word, and doe his commandements, honor his name, auoid prophane ſwearing, ſanctifie his Sabbaoth, and come as nigh to the perfect obedience of his law, as poſſibly we can, if with this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant we renounce all our worldly both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and pleaſures, and haue not the intention of this Merchant in our minds, to illuſtrate Gods glorie, and let our end be God; God
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19506:99"/>will not bleſſe or fauour theſe our doings, or giue them enteraunce and paſſage vnto him.</p>
               <p>For as before in ſinne, ſo in euery good worke there are two chiefe reſpects: The one is the honour which redoundeth vnto God: The ſecond is the profit that returneth to our ſelues. If therfore in a good action, we rather haue an eie to our priuate aduantage, then to the publike praiſe of God, we diſcouer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our worldly minds too much, that gold more then God, the world aboue the word is eſteemed of vs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let vs looke, that as we ſerue him, ſo he will ſerue vs: if we ſerue him with the worſt, and with the laſt, he will ſerue vs with the dregges and bottome of the cup of his wrath,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73</note> and will make vs ſucke them vp.</p>
               <p>The end before God is of more valew, then either the greatneſſe or excellency of the action: for euery action ſhall be weighed by the intention, and reſpected, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced according to the end.</p>
               <p>This the ſubtile ſerpent knoweth well; wherfore, as he broght <hi>Adam</hi> to another tree,<note place="margin">Gen. 1</note> that he might not taſte of the tree of life: ſo he bringeth vs to any other end, that we might not follow the true end, which God hath
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19506:100"/>commanded vs to ſet before our eies in al our enterpriſes.</p>
               <p>When he cannot ſtrip vs of ſuch excellent works, as the Lord worketh in vs, he deprau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by diſgracing our intentions in them, ſuggeſting, that they were wrought to ſome priuate worldly end.</p>
               <p>For thus he ſophiſticated and gloſed with God, vpon the inclination of <hi>Iob</hi> his deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for, vpon the commendation of <hi>Iob</hi> his diſpoſition, which God had made vnto him, how that he was a <hi>iust man, and one that feared God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 1</note> Behold how this iugler priuily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth him, diueth to the depth of him, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at the heart and reines of him, ſnatcheth at the ſecret intendment of his mind, that <hi>Iob</hi> his religion ſtood with good policie, for thus he deſcanteth vpon <hi>Iob</hi> his deuotion: <hi>Doth Iob ſerue God for nought? Haſt thou not made a hedge about him, and about his ſubſtance, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all that he hath on euery ſide? Thou haſt bleſſed the worke of his hands, and his ſubſtance is increaſed in the land: But ſtretch out now thy hand, and touch that he hath, to ſee if he will not blaſpheme thee to thy face:</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaide, hee worketh on the ſurer ſide, and playeth vpon the aduantage; his gaine is his godlineſſe, but touch him in his purſe, and croſſe him awhile in his eſtate and ſubſtance,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19506:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>and the caſe will ſoone be altered with him, and <hi>Iob</hi> I will warrant you, will not proue the man you take him for.</p>
               <p>Thus he doth like Pioners in the warres,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> who digge at the foundation, wherevpon the whole weight of the building leaneth. He doth not deny a matter manifeſt, ſuch attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and praiſes as God doth giue to <hi>Iob:</hi> but he wrangleth and cauelleth about the maner, which he knew well enough, if it had bin true, would haue ouer-throwne all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Well, this will be a bone, wherewith he will choake vs vpon our death beddes; let vs deliuer our ſelues of it as wee can: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we haue ſerued God for nought, is the queſtion propounded to vs to aſſoile, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and inward affections, at that time wilbe throughly canuiſed. Let vs proue them therefore, and examine them before,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 111</note> that there be no frawd and wickedneſſe in them, ſo ſhal they be able to ſtand in the iudgement and congregation of the iuſt.</p>
               <p>Set therefore this watch-woord of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle before thy race,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9</note>

               <p>It is with vs,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> as it is with the wind-mill which grindeth not the corne into meale, without a gale of wind which may turne it round about: we cannot turne vs to any good action, vnleſſe we may be puffed and rocked to and fro with the winde of worldely vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>Good workes are as good wine, but done in a bad mind, we mingle worme-wood and gall with it, and do like the Iewes, who tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered gall in their cup of drinke, that they gaue to Chriſt.

               <p>To be blinde in ſoule, and to be ignorant of Gods word, is a farre more horrible and palpable blindnes than that which the Lorde in iudgement did bring vpon the land of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,<note place="margin">Exod. 10.</note> which was ſo foggy and groſſe for the time, as one man could not ſee an other, or once ſtirre out of the place wherein he was.</p>
               <p>For whereas man conſiſteth of two parts, the body and the ſoule, how farre the ſoule doth exceede the body, it is not ſo eaſie for vs to define. But this is moſt manifeſt, that the body, if it might be ſundred from the ſoule, litle differeth from the bodies of bruit beaſts: &amp; if that the ſoule might be ſingled from the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:19506:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>body, it would be but little inferior vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall ſpirites.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer ornament,<note place="margin">A ſimilitude.</note> grace, and feature is in the body, it hath it from the ſoule, his vigor, functions, and naturall induments are from thence deriued. For, as the beautie and brauery of a picture ouer-layde with golde, conſiſteth not in the woodden ſubiect, but in the orient, and golden forme, which beeing defaced and put out, it is nothing but a rude, and deformed ſubſtance: ſo the ſoule beeing the life, and the liuelihoode of the man, which giueth eſſence and forme vnto the man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from the body, the body becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a moſt vncleane carrion, moſt vgly and fearefull vnto vs to behold. Yet in moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous and brainſicke maner, al the whole care is ſet vpon the body, and we grow moſt remiſſe and careleſſe of the ſoule. The baſe bond-woman the fleſh is aduaunced, and ſet in the higher roome, and the ſpirit our peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and beautiful lady, to her great diſgrace is debaſed, and put downe to the lowermoſt end.</p>
               <p>If the body be diſeaſed, how many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians are ſent for to ſuccor it? if in want, what cares do we take to ſupply it? if in danger, we runne through thicke and thinne to ſhunne it: but the deadly diſeaſe, the wofull want, the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:19506:109"/>extreameſt danger that can be of the ſoule, is not reſpected of vs.</p>
               <p>Whereas the ſoule is the Miſtris, and the body but the chamber-mayde: whereas the ſoule is the rider, and the body but the beaſt that beareth the rider: loe, the minion mayd is graced, and her Miſtris deſpiſed: the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler iade is ſtroaked, and the rider is thrown off, and caſt vnto the ground.</p>
               <p>The body is but the garment, &amp; couerlet of the ſoule. It is meere madneſſe for any to ſpoyle his body, that he might not ſpoyle his garment: ſo is it for vs to ſaue the body, to deſtroy the ſoule.</p>
               <p>If all outward things be ordayned for the body, and the body bee created for the ſoule, and the ſoule for God: is it not groſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde follie, to buſie our ſelues wholly about thoſe things that are to this end, and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the maine poynt of all, which is the end it ſelfe? To prouide ſuch ſtuffe as may ſette vp a houſe, and neuer to goe in hand with the houſe. To get many bookes, and to procure vs many teachers, and yet to make no vſe of theſe bookes and teachers? To goe to warre, and to be carefull to haue a fine ſcabard ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melld &amp; emboſſed with pearle, &amp; with gold, and not to care for the matter of the blade, whether it be of yron, or of lead, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19506:110"/>baſe and impure ſubſtances? The bodie is the ſubiect, and as it were the caſe, &amp; ſheath of the ſoule, wherein the ſoule is hidden: it is a franticke faſhion therefore, to be ſo curious and nice about the pleaſures of the body, and to be ſo careleſſe, and vnwiſe for the treaſure of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Let vs lay them both together, and weigh them in the ballaunce of iudgement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and the diſproportion that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare betweene them, will conuince in our election, our too too blinde and preiudicate affections.</p>
